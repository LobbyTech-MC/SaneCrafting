## SaneCrafting
A tiny addon QoL addon to make Slimefun feel more vanilla-y by allowing Enhanced Crafting Table recipes to be crafted in a normal Crafting Table.

## Features
- Allows crafting all Enhanced Crafting Table recipes in a regular crafting grid
- Adds all Enhanced Crafting Table recipes to the Recipe Book so you can autofill them JEI-style (Caveat: The recipe book can't correctly identify which of the new recipes can be crafted with the material in your inventory, so some may show up as craftable when they're not - this is an inbuilt limitation of Minecraft)
- Recipes will only show up in crafting book once researched (and obviously will be uncraftable until then)
